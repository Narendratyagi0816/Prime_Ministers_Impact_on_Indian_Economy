    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="content">
        Since gaining independence in 1947, India’s economy has evolved under the leadership of various Prime Ministers, each leaving a distinct imprint on the nation’s economic trajectory. Broadly, this journey can be divided into three phases: the <strong>Nehruvian era (1947-1964)</strong>, characterized by <strong>state control and economic planning</strong>; the <strong>period of economic reforms (1964-1990)</strong>, marked by <strong>incremental changes</strong>; and the <strong>liberalization era (1991 onwards)</strong>, which opened India to global markets.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        <strong>Jawaharlal Nehru</strong>, India's first Prime Minister, laid the foundation of a <strong>mixed economy</strong>, balancing public and private sectors with a focus on <strong>self-reliance and infrastructure development</strong>. The economic model changed significantly under <strong>P.V. Narasimha Rao</strong>, who, along with Finance Minister <strong>Manmohan Singh</strong>, introduced sweeping <strong>liberalization reforms in 1991</strong> that marked India's shift to a <strong>market-driven economy</strong>, embracing globalization.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        <strong>Atal Bihari Vajpayee</strong> emphasized <strong>infrastructure development</strong> and <strong>privatization</strong>, setting the stage for future reforms. Under <strong>Manmohan Singh</strong>, India witnessed one of its <strong>fastest growth periods</strong>, powered by global trade and the expansion of the <strong>IT sector</strong>, though economic challenges at the end of his tenure required fresh leadership.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        In 2014, <strong>Narendra Modi</strong> became the 14th Prime Minister of India, ushering in an era of <strong>ambitious reforms</strong> aimed at transforming the economy. His government focused on <strong>modernizing key sectors</strong>, <strong>reducing poverty</strong>, and <strong>accelerating growth</strong> through initiatives like <strong>Make in India</strong>, <strong>Digital India</strong>, <strong>Goods and Services Tax (GST)</strong>, and <strong>demonetization</strong>. These policies reshaped India’s economic landscape, attracting <strong>foreign investment</strong> and boosting growth across various industries. However, they have also been criticized for their impact on <strong>employment</strong>, <strong>income inequality</strong>, and the <strong>informal economy</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        This webpage will explore the <strong>economic impact</strong> of Prime Minister <strong>Narendra Modi's leadership</strong>, assess <strong>key policies and their outcomes</strong>, and analyze the <strong>challenges faced</strong>. We will also compare his <strong>economic legacy</strong> with that of his predecessors, offering a comprehensive view of how different Prime Ministers have influenced India’s economy over the years.

    <h2>The History of Economic Development in India Since Independence</h2>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
        In the early 1950s, India’s newly independent leaders faced significant challenges. The country had a <strong>population accounting for one-seventh of the world</strong> and an <strong>average income only one-fifteenth that of Americans</strong>. With <strong>75% engaged in agriculture</strong> and <strong>literacy at a mere 14%</strong>, the need for economic reform was urgent.
    </p>

    <h3>Initial Strategy</h3>
    <p>
        India adopted a <strong>centrally planned approach</strong> aimed at <strong>rapid industrialization</strong>, establishing large <strong>state-owned enterprises (SOEs)</strong> in heavy industries such as <strong>steel and chemicals</strong>. This strategy sought to develop a <strong>“socialistic pattern of society”</strong> while leaving consumer goods production to small, labor-intensive cottage industries.
    </p>

    <h3>Initial Results</h3>
    <p>
        While industrialization yielded <strong>moderate success</strong>, several challenges emerged. Politically motivated SOEs struggled with <strong>profitability</strong>, and <strong>inflation</strong> led to black markets. Agrarian reforms largely failed, resulting in a <strong>food crisis in the mid-1960s</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Change in Strategies</h3>
    <p>
        In response to the food crisis, the government promoted <strong>modern agricultural practices</strong>, leading to the <strong>Green Revolution</strong> and <strong>self-sufficiency in food grains</strong>. However, increased intervention in industry resulted in stagnation, with <strong>per capita income growth averaging less than 1% annually from 1966 to 1980</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>The About Turn</h3>
    <p>
        By the 1980s, India began to <strong>liberalize its economy</strong>, culminating in 1991 with major reforms that embraced <strong>liberalization, privatization, and globalization</strong>. This shift resulted in an <strong>average growth rate of 6.3%</strong> and a marked <strong>reduction in poverty levels</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Remaining Challenges</h3>
    <p>
        Despite impressive growth, India faces significant challenges. There is a stark divide between a <strong>productive formal sector</strong> and a <strong>low-productivity informal sector</strong>, along with deficiencies in <strong>public services</strong> and persistent <strong>environmental issues</strong>.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="content">
        The economic history of India since independence is a tale of dramatic transformations, marked by shifting strategies and varying degrees of success and challenges. From the initial focus on <strong>state-led industrialization</strong> under <strong>Jawaharlal Nehru</strong> to the <strong>liberalization reforms</strong> initiated by <strong>P.V. Narasimha Rao</strong> and <strong>Manmohan Singh</strong>, and the ambitious modernization efforts by <strong>Narendra Modi</strong>, each phase has left an indelible mark on the nation's economic landscape.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        The early years were characterized by a <strong>centrally planned economy</strong> aimed at <strong>self-reliance</strong> and <strong>industrial growth</strong>. While this strategy yielded some success in establishing heavy industries, it also led to <strong>inefficiencies</strong>, <strong>political interference</strong>, and <strong>economic stagnation</strong>. The mid-1960s food crisis highlighted the drawbacks of neglecting agriculture, prompting the <strong>Green Revolution</strong>, which significantly improved food security but also exacerbated economic disparities.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        The <strong>liberalization era</strong>, starting in the 1990s, marked a significant turning point. The shift towards a <strong>market-driven economy</strong>, coupled with globalization, spurred robust economic growth, reduced poverty levels, and integrated India into the global market. However, this period also brought challenges, including a stark divide between the <strong>productive formal sector</strong> and the <strong>low-productivity informal sector</strong>, as well as deficiencies in <strong>public services</strong> and <strong>infrastructure</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        Under <strong>Narendra Modi's</strong> leadership, the focus has been on modernization, digitalization, and infrastructural development. Initiatives like <strong>Make in India</strong>, <strong>Digital India</strong>, and the implementation of <strong>GST</strong> have aimed to boost manufacturing, enhance digital infrastructure, and simplify the tax structure. While these policies have attracted foreign investment and spurred economic growth, they have also faced criticism for their impact on <strong>employment</strong>, <strong>income inequality</strong>, and the <strong>informal economy</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        Despite the impressive strides made over the decades, significant challenges remain. <strong>High levels of unemployment</strong>, <strong>income inequality</strong>, <strong>agricultural distress</strong>, and <strong>infrastructure deficits</strong> continue to pose hurdles. Moreover, <strong>policy implementation issues</strong> and <strong>bureaucratic hurdles</strong> often impede progress.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        Looking ahead, India's economic future will depend on its ability to address these challenges and create an <strong>inclusive growth model</strong> that benefits all segments of society. The lessons learned from the past, combined with innovative and adaptive policies, will be crucial in navigating the complexities of a rapidly changing global economy. As India continues its journey of economic development, the leadership of its Prime Ministers will remain a pivotal factor in shaping the nation's economic destiny.
